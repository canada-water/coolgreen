# custom startpage
This is a simple pseudo-terminal startpage for any web browser. Currently, I use it on Firefox, but it should work with any other browser. The custom links are easy enough for you to customize yourself, as I'm sure you really don't need my college links or all my entertainment forms. Have fun with it.
