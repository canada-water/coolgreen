# coolgreen
## introduction
**coolgreen** is my current dwm rice, which has a nice, deep green color scheme. With some minor configuration, this rice can easily be deployed on any Linux distro with as little hassle as possible thanks to convenient installation scripts I have provided. These scripts streamline the installation process, installing the dependencies required for the keybindings I use on a daily basis. These applications currently include Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Firefox, Discord, the Thunar file manager, Rhythmbox, and Spotify.
